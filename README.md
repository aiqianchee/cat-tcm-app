⚙️ Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed:
Java 17+
Maven 3+
Node.js 18+ and npm

🚀 Running the Application
1. Run Backend (Spring Boot)
cd Meow
mvn spring-boot:run
Backend will start on: http://localhost:8080

2. Run Frontend (React Dev Server)
cd cat-tcm-frontend
npm install   # first time only
npm start
Frontend will start on: http://localhost:3000

3. Access APIs (examples)
http://localhost:8080/about → About Us JSON
http://localhost:8080/scope → Scope of Treatment JSON
http://localhost:8080/contact → Contact info JSON

📦 Building for Production
Build React:
cd cat-tcm-frontend
npm run build

This creates a build/ folder.

Copy build/ into Spring Boot’s src/main/resources/static/.
Now Spring Boot serves React directly.

Package into one JAR:
cd Meow
mvn clean package
java -jar target/meow-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

Access everything at: http://localhost:8080

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: React, React Router, Fetch API / Axios
Backend: Spring Boot, REST Controllers
Build Tools: Maven, npm
Deployment: Single JAR (Spring Boot + React)
